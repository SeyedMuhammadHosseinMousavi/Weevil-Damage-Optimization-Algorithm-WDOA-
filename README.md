% Weevils are a type insect with elongated snouts coming from superfamily of 
% Curculionoidea with approximately 97,000 species. Most of them consider pest and
% cause environmental damages but some kinds like wheat weevil, maize weevil, and 
% boll weevils are famous to cause huge damage on crops, especially cereal grains. 
% This research is proposed a novel swarm-based metaheuristics algorithms called 
% Weevil Damage Optimization Algorithm (WDOA) which mimics weevilsâ€™ fly power, 
% snout power, and damage power on crops or agricultural products. The proposed 
% algorithm is tested with 12 benchmark unimodal and multimodal artificial landscapes
% or optimization test functions.
